# Codex Worklog

Updated: 2026-04-25, Europe/Berlin.

Current task: keep maintainer memory aligned with the repo-root `Problems` file and the active review artifact.

## Current State

- The user problem source is the repo-root `Problems` file.
- Active review artifact: `docs/problem-review-plan-2026-04-25.md`.
- The active problem set is limited to four items:
  - remove legacy commands from the product surface and docs
  - extend auto-unmute to the reported headphones/deafen case
  - fix tracking so all channels are tracked instead of one live channel with stale others
  - fix `/userinfo` status and banner behavior

## Documentation Notes

- Maintainer docs should describe legacy commands as removed work, not intentionally retained compatibility aliases.
- The review artifact should stay scoped to the four user-listed problems unless `Problems` changes.
- Keep memory concise; broader infra and test-review details belong in the review artifact, not here.

## Files To Check When Resuming

- `docs/problem-review-plan-2026-04-25.md`
- `CODEX_WORKLOG.md`
- `AGENTS_README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
